> It's the best iPhone that we have ever created. <br>
> â€• Tim Cook, at the Apple Special Event on September 7, 2016

I picked up my iPhone 7 Jet Black 128GB model for $749 plus tax on October 16, 2016 to replace my battery-swelling iPhone 5. As my daily driver, it managed to do its job decently for the most part of the next 6 years, serving as the primary access point to phone/video calls, social networks and the Internet in general, although it did begin to struggle toward its final days.  

With the release of iOS 16 in September 2022, Apple officially dropped its support for the iPhone 7 series, concluding the lifecycle of the 2016 product - well, so did I. Today, I will be taking one last look at the phone in my pocket for the longest time, revisiting its launch, design choices and 6-year service, as well as hints of its influence on the products that followed, before locking it away in the pantheon of digital history.

## Launch
On September 7, 2016, Tim Cook unveiled the iPhone 7 series at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. The next lineup in the iPhone family included the regular iPhone 7 and the bigger iPhone 7 plus. Either model came equipped with an A10 Fusion chip that was, in Apple's words, 40% faster than its predecessor A9 found in the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. Both of them also featured 12-megapixel camera capable of optical image stabilization, something only available to the Plus model previously, but the 7 Plus model offered one additional 12-megapixel telephoto camera and portrait mode to create bokeh in photos. In addition, the iPhone 7 series introduced a haptic home button, stereo speakers, and a water-and-dust-resistant body, all for the first time on an iPhone.

## Headphone Jack
One of the biggest controversies surrounding the launch of iPhone 7 was its headphone jack, or the absence of one. Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, indeed sounded a little defensive when he took three whole minutes on stage characterizing it as a "courageous" move to challenge the long-established practice. Since then, Apple doubled down on the design with every subsequent iPhone release. The bet paid off.The Android camp fought back for a year or two before giving in eventually. Consumers have also learned to embrace the age of wireless audio, to the point where today, a headphone-jack-less phone has become all but the new default, at least among flagship smartphones on the market. It all began with this phone.

| Model | Year | Have a headphone jack? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iPhone 14 Series | 2022 | No |
| Samsung Galaxy S22 Series | 2022 | No |
| Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 & Z Fold 4 | 2022 | No |
| Google Pixel 7 Series | 2022 | No |
| OnePlus 10 Seires | 2022 | No |
| Moto Edge+ | 2022 | No |

## Home Button and Touch ID
The removal of a headphone jack, according to Phil Schiller, freed up enough of the precious internal space in order to make room for another pivotal feature: an immoveable yet clicky home button. Gone were the mechanical home buttons common to all iPhones prior, probably one of the most vulnerable parts of the hardware. The new, improved home button was physically incapable of movement of any sorts, but the "taptic engine" inside would instead provide a subtle, vibrational feedback whenever the home button was pressed. The end result was an unmistakable impression of tactile "clicky-ness". It just felt right.

Meanwhile, biometrics-based identification as a whole has only become more ubiquitous than ever six years later. The Touch ID technology that began with iPhone 5s (2015), along with its extension, Face ID introduced with iPhone X (2017), made it virtually impossible to go back to a time when the safety of data in your phone meant having to type a passcode each time it needed to be unlocked. Between the two though, I still have a slight preference for Touch ID, due to its versatility and the attention-free unlocking experience.

## Camera
iPhone 7 12-megapixel camera, the same pixel count as iPhone 6s that would remain unchallenged until the iPhone 14 Pro line in 2022.

## Reliability
Battery is where the 6-year old phone truly shows its age. In 2016, iPhone 7 was claimed to have longest battery life ever in an iPhone. That. In fact, it has become so bad in the last year or so that I wouldn't dare going outside without a power bank for an extended period of time.

Shortly after iPhone 7's launch, battery emerged at the center of a controversy dubbed "batterygate". For years there had been anecdotal evidence suggesting that older models of iPhone became increasingly slower with each iOS upgrade, leading people to speculate that it was a concious decision at Apple to encourage people toward buying a new one, a practice known as "planned obsolescence". The batterygate culminated with Apple's apology in December 2017 where it promised to offer battery replacements at a reduced cost for a year and better transparency on battery and performance management in the future. Today, battery-induced performance throttling is still very much a thing. The phone performs about 40-50% slower when the system decides so, even without entering low battery mode.

## Wrap-up
iPhone 7 was okay. It was neither as incremental as the iPhone 8 one year later, nor as radical as the iPhone X one year later as well. The lack of headphone jack hasn't been as big of a deal as many of the critics argued it was back then.

Reliving 2016.

> It's the best iPhone that we have ever created.  <br>
> â€• Tim Cook, at the Apple Special Event on September 7, 2016

I picked up my iPhone 7 Jet Black 128GB model for $749 plus tax on October 16, 2016 to replace my battery-swelling iPhone 5. As my daily driver, it managed to do its job decently for the most part of the next 6 years, serving as the primary access point to phone/video calls, social networks and the Internet in general, although it did begin to struggle during its final days.  

With the release of iOS 16 in September 2022, Apple officially dropped its support for the iPhone 7 series, concluding the lifecycle of the 2016 product - well, so did I. Today, I will be taking one last look at the phone in my pocket for the longest time, revisiting its launch, design choices and 6-year service, as well as hints of its influence on the products that followed, before locking it up in the pantheon of digital history.

## Launch
On September 7, 2016, Tim Cook unveiled the iPhone 7 series in San Francisco. The next lineup in the iPhone family included the regular iPhone 7 and the bigger iPhone 7 plus. Either model came equipped with an A10 Fusion chip that was, in Apple's words, 40% faster than its predecessor A9 found in the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. Both of them also featured 12-megapixel camera capable of optical image stabilization, something only available to the Plus model previously, but the 7 Plus model offered one additional 12-megapixel telephoto camera and portrait mode to create bokeh in photos. In addition, the iPhone 7 series introduced a haptic home button, stereo speakers, and a water-and-dust-resistant body, all for the first time on an iPhone.

## Headphone Jack
One of the biggest controversies surrounding the launch of iPhone 7 was its headphone jack, or the absence of one. Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, indeed sounded a little defensive when he took three whole minutes on stage characterizing it as a "courageous" move to challenge a long-established practice. Since then, Apple doubled down on the move with every subsequent iPhone release. The bet paid off.The Android camp fought back for a year or two before giving in eventually. Consumers have also learned to embrace the age of wireless audio, to the point where today, a headphone-jack-less phone has become all but the new default, at least among flagship smartphones on the market.

| Model | Year | Have a headphone jack? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iPhone 14 Series | 2022 | No |
| Samsung Galaxy S22 Series | 2022 | No |
| Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 & Z Fold 4 | 2022 | No |
| Google Pixel 7 Series | 2022 | No |
| OnePlus 10 Seires | 2022 | No |
| Moto Edge+ | 2022 | No |

## Home Button and Touch ID
The removal of a headphone jack, according to Phil Schiller, freed up enough precious internal space in order to make room for another pivotal feature: an immoveable yet clicky home button. Gone were the mechanical home buttons common to all iPhones prior, probably one of the most vulnerable parts of the hardware. The new, improved home button was physically incapable of movement of any sorts, but the "taptic engine" inside would instead provide a subtle, vibrational feedback whenever the home button was pressed, giving it the unmistakable impression of tactile "clicky-ness". It just felt right.

Six years later, biometrics-based identification as a whole have only become more ubiquitous than ever. Touch ID, along with its extension, Face ID, introduced with iPhone X (2017), made it almost impossible to go back to a time when the safety of data in your phone meant having to type a passcode each time you need to unlock it.

## Camera
12-megapixel camera, the same pixel count of which was only recently outdone by the iPhone 14 Pro line (2022).

## Reliability
Battery is where the 6-year old phone truly shows its age. In 2016, iPhone 7 was claimed to have longest battery life ever in an iPhone. It became so bad that in the last years or so, I wouldn't dare leaving my place without a power bank for an extended period of time.

## Wrap-up
It was neither as incremental as the iPhone 8 one year later, nor as radical as the iPhone X one year later as well.

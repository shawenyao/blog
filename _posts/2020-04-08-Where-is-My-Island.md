I've been playing _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_, where my in-game character flew to a deserted island in order to start a new life. Despite its cartoony art style, the game runs with an astonishing level of realism, to the point where it almost feels like a living and breathing world. I know for a fact that my island exists somewhere in the northern hemisphere; I know that the sun rises and sets there every real-world day; I know that the seasons rotate and spring is coming. I wonder how much further I can push it, e.g., do we know where my island is?


## The Longitude
Due to fact that the game running on the real-world lock, my deserted island must be conveniently located in the same time zone as where I physically am (or at least wherever my system is set). So there you go - it can't be too far off.

## The Latitude


## Putting It All Together

Can adding additional explanatory variable make previously-insiginificant ones significant?

You are conducting regression with lots of varibales. You find one of them highly-insiginificant. You are leaning towards to dropping it.

In this stylized example, I show that there exisits a certain category of explanatory variable (formerly known as [*suppressor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation_(statistics)#Other_third_variables)), the inclusion of which will increase the explanatory power of exisiting variables (even the non-significant ones).


This calls for caution when we delete explanatory variable soley based on its insiginificance, as there might be *suppressor* lurking out there that has the potential of turning it into gold.

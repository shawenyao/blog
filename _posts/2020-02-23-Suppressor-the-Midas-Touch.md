Can adding additional explanatory variable make previously-insiginificant ones significant?

You are conducting regression with lots of varibales. You find one of them highly-insiginificant. You are leaning towards to dropping it.


This calls for caution when we delete explanatory variable soley based on its insiginificance, as there might be *suppressor* lurking out there that has the potential of turning it into gold.

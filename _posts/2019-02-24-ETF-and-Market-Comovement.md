A glimpse of what the promised land looks like.

One of the most intriguing phenomena of financial market is its _dynamism_. Unlike physics where the law of nature is (to a large extent) independent of human awarness, market responds, adapts and evolves based on what we know about it. For starters, Fama and French's discovery of value and size effect led to a new fashion under the brand named factor investing; likewise, we have never looked at options the same way since Black, Scholes and Merton uncovered the world of geometric Brownian motion; more commonly, arbitrageurs sniff around on a daily basis, exploiting mispricing until it goes way. In all of these instances, it is the knowledge we possess that decides what action we take, leaving a permanent mark on how market behaves.

One of such curious cases is the modern portfolio theory. Harry Markowitz forsees a world where everybody holds the optimal risky asset known as the market portfolio.

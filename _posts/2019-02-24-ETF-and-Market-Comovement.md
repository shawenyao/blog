A glimpse of the promised land.

Arguably, one of the most intriguing phenomena of the market is its _dynamism_. Unlike physics where the law of nature is to a large extent independent of human awarness, market responds, adapts and evolves based on what we know about it. For starters, Fama and French's discovery of value and size effect led to a whole new school known as factor investing; likewise, we have never looked at options the same way since Black, Scholes and Merton uncovered the world of geometric Brownian motion; more commonly, arbitrageurs sniff around on a daily basis, exploiting mispricing until it goes way. In all of these instances, it is the knowledge we possess that leads to the action we take, leaving a permanent mark on how market behaves.

One of such curious cases is the modern portfolio theory. Harry Markowitz foresees a world where everybody holds the same optimal risky asset. As the separation property states, investors move along the capital allocation line based on their individual risk preferences, holding a combination of the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio. In equilibrium, the total supply equals the total demand, so the tangency portfolio has to be the value-weighted portfolio of all risky assets - or simply put, the market portfolio.

However, the story doesn't end there.

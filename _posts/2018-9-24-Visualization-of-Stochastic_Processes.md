title: Visualization of Stochastic Processes
---


Stochastic process makes for an excellent source of visualization. In this demo, I show the dynamics of stochastic processes along the three physical diemensions:

* `t`: time
* `x`: the value of the stochastic process at time `t`
* `f(x)`: the probability density (or the probablity mass in the discrete case) of `x` at time `t`

Note that the expected value (or the closest permissible value in the discrete case) at each time `t` is also highlighted.

All plots are meant to be interactive. Drag to rotate and scroll to zoom in/out on WebGL-compatable devices. Certain feature like drift, dispersion, mean-reversion or non-negativeness might be more clearly visible from a different angle.

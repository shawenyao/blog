Or, how to wait for traffic signals optimally?

You are commuting by foot in Manhattan. You wish to go from point A to point B. The only thing standing in your way is the numerous traffic lights. How should you strategize? Do you go north or east first?

Since there's no obvious advantage or disadvantage going either way, you decide to let the green light lead your way. All goes well until you've reached point C or point D, where finally, you might have to wait for the traffic light to turn green.

I am not sure about you, but I would very much prefer to be at point D.

Why? Because red and green lights aren't evenly distributed. Usually, the main roads will get a bigger share of green signal, while the minor ones will get more red.

Or, how to wait for traffic signals optimally?

You are on your commute to work in Manhattan. You wish to go from point A to point B. Your only challenge is the numerous traffic lights standing in your way. How should you strategize? Do you go north or east?

Since there's no obvious advantage or disadvantage going either way, you decide to let the green light lead your way. The only real decision comes at either point C or point D.

I am not sure about you, but I would very much prefer to be at point D.

Why? Because usually, red and green lights aren't evenly distributed. The main roads will get a bigger share of green light, while the minor ones will more red.

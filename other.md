## CHAPTER ONE: THE CAT WHO SLEPT

By and large, today seemed to be one of those days that were fairly insignificant in a human's life. The weather was lovely in the Bay Area, if not a little chilly, as usual. The S&P 500 opened flat, shrugging off another rate hike from the day before. The Earth continued its journey, circling the Sun for the 265th time of the year. Yet on this day, our story began in a small town called Walnut Creek.

"Wake up! We have a big day ahead."
